/**
 * An extensions of FileManager wich deals with files uploaded via a PHP form.
 * Binary strings are replaced by temporary filenames of uploaded files (the
 * one given by $_FILE['field_name']['tmp_name']), and thus adding a value
 * means moving the uploaded file from the temporary directory to its new
 * directory, and renaming with the convention used by the FileManager. If no
 * key is specified when a file is added, the sha1 of the file (and not of its
 * name) is computed instead. Nothing else changes from a FileManager. An
 * UploadManager instance is obviously file-only.
 *
 * Note that no check on the given temporary file names is performed, and is
 * the responsability of the client of that class.
